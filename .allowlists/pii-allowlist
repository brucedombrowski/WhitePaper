# PII Allowlist for WhitePaper
# Format: file:line:hash  # justification
#
# The LaTeX log file (whitepaper.log) contains "15000+600000" which matches
# the international phone number pattern. This is a false positive — it is a
# TeX capacity statistic, not PII. The .log file is also in .gitignore.
#
# Note: .log files are gitignored and excluded from the repository.
# This allowlist exists for completeness when scanning the working directory.
